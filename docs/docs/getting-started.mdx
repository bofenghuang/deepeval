**DeepEval** is an open-source evaluation framework for LLMs. DeepEval makes it extremely easy to build
and iterate on LLM (applications) and was built with the following principles in mind:

- Easily "unit test" LLM outputs in a similar way to Pytest.
- Plug-and-use 30+ LLM-evaluated metrics, most with research backing.
- Supports both end-to-end and component level evaluation.
- Evaluation for RAG, agents, chatbots, and virtually any use case.
- Synthetic dataset generation with state-of-the-art evolution techniques.
- Metrics are simple to customize and covers all use cases.
- Red team, safety scan LLM applications for security vulnerabilities.

Additionally, DeepEval has a cloud platform [Confident AI](https://app.confident-ai.com), which allow teams to use DeepEval to **evaluate, regression test, red team, and monitor** LLM applications on the cloud.

## Create Your First Test Run

Create a test file to run your first **end-to-end evaluation**. An [LLM test case](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#llm-test-case) in deepeval is represents a single unit of LLM app interaction (for a series of LLM interactions i.e. conversation, visit the [conversational test cases](/docs/evaluation-multiturn-test-cases) section instead).

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Single‑turn vs Multi‑turn vs Agentic vs Arena Evaluations</strong>
  </summary>

Depending on your use case, you may want to run single‑turn, multi‑turn,
[agentic](/docs/getting-started#evaluate-nested-components), or [arena evaluations](/docs/getting-started#compare-llm-responses). Certain use cases may also demand running multiple
types of evaluation. For example, a travel booking assistant might be
conversational and agentic at the same time.

- **Single‑turn**: evaluates a single LLM interaction. Suitable
  for non‑conversational use cases such as meeting summarizers, writing
  assistants, Q&amp;A agents, and translators.
- **Multi‑turn**: evaluates a sequence of LLM interactions.
  Suitable for conversational agents like customer‑support chatbots or
  travel‑booking assistants.
- **Agentic**: evaluates a single traced LLM interaction. Ideal
  for complex agents with multiple components such as browser automation
  agents, code‑generation agents, and deep‑research agents.
- **Arena**: evaluates multiple single-turn interactions with the same user input to find the best interaction. Ideal
  for comparing different iterations of your LLM app, such as when picking the best models and prompts for your application.

Single‑turn evaluations require an [LLM test case](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#llm-test-case), which represents a single interaction in `deepeval`. Multi-turn evaluations require [multi-turn test cases](/docs/evaluation-multiturn-test-cases), which represent a sequence of interactions. Arena evaluations require [arena test cases](/docs/evaluation-arena-test-cases), which represents a collection of single-turn LLM Test Cases with the same input. Finally, agentic evaluations require you to set up tracing.

from deepeval.metrics import GEval

def test_correctness():
    correctness_metric = GEval(
        name="Correctness",
        criteria="Determine if the 'actual output' is correct based on the 'expected output'.",
        evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT],
        threshold=0.5
    )
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input="I have a persistent cough and fever. Should I be worried?",
        # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
        actual_output="A persistent cough and fever could be a viral infection or something more serious. See a doctor if symptoms worsen or don't improve in a few days.",
        expected_output="A persistent cough and fever could indicate a range of illnesses, from a mild viral infection to more serious conditions like pneumonia or COVID-19. You should seek medical attention if your symptoms worsen, persist for more than a few days, or are accompanied by difficulty breathing, chest pain, or other concerning signs."
    )
    assert_test(test_case, [correctness_metric])
```

Run `deepeval test run` from the root directory of your project to evaluate your LLM app **end-to-end**:

```bash
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

Congratulations! Your test case should have passed ✅ Let's breakdown what happened.

- The variable `input` mimics a user input, and `actual_output` is a placeholder for what your application's supposed to output based on this input.
- The variable `expected_output` represents the ideal answer for a given `input`, and [`GEval`](/docs/metrics-llm-evals) is a research-backed metric provided by `deepeval` for you to evaluate your LLM output's on any custom metric with human-like accuracy.
- In this example, the metric `criteria` is correctness of the `actual_output` based on the provided `expected_output`, but not all metrics require an `expected_output`.
- All metric scores range from 0 - 1, which the `threshold=0.5` threshold ultimately determines if your test have passed or not.

If you run more than one test run, you will be able to **catch regressions** by comparing test cases side-by-side. This is also made easier if you're using `deepeval` alongside Confident AI ([see below](/docs/getting-started#save-results-on-cloud) for video demo).

Congratulations! Your test case should have passed ✅ Let's breakdown what happened.

- The variable `role` distinguishes between the end user and your LLM application, and `content` contains either the user’s input or the LLM’s output.
- In this example, the `criteria` metric evaluates the professionalism of the sequence of `content`.
- All metric scores range from 0 - 1, which the `threshold=0.5` threshold ultimately determines if your test have passed or not.

If you run more than one test run, you will be able to **catch regressions** by comparing test cases side-by-side. This is also made easier if you're using `deepeval` alongside Confident AI ([see below](/docs/getting-started#save-results-on-cloud) for video demo).

<details> <summary><strong>Set up your LLM Provider</strong> </summary>

You'll need to configure your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment
variable to run `GEval`.

Most deepeval metrics including `GEval` are LLM-judge metrics, and default to using OpenAI's `gpt-4.1`, but you can specify any OpenAI model you wish to use:

```python
correctness_metric = GEval(..., model="o1")
```

DeepEval also integrates with these model providers:

- [Ollama](https://deepeval.com/integrations/models/ollama)
- [Azure OpenAI](https://deepeval.com/integrations/models/azure-openai)
- [Anthropic](https://deepeval.com/integrations/models/anthropic)
- [Gemini](https://deepeval.com/integrations/models/gemini)
- [Vertex AI](https://deepeval.com/integrations/models/vertex-ai)
- [vLLM](https://deepeval.com/integrations/models/vllm)
- [LMStudio](https://deepeval.com/integrations/models/lmstudio)

To use **ANY** custom LLM of your choice, [check out this part of the
docs](/guides/guides-using-custom-llms).

### Save Results

It is recommended that you manage your evaluation suite on Confident AI, the `deepeval` platform.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="confident-ai" label="Confident AI">

It is **highly recommended** to save results on Confident AI, the `deepeval` cloud, to make your evaluation life easier. Run `deepeval login` (or [click here](https://app.confident-ai.com)) in the CLI to get your API key.

```bash
deepeval login
```

Or, you can also run `deepeval view`

```bash
deepeval view
```

After you've pasted in your API key, Confident AI will **generate testing reports and automate regression testing** whenever you run a test run to evaluate your LLM application inside any environment, at any scale, anywhere.

/>

**Once you've ran more than one test run**, you'll be able to use the [regression testing page](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs/llm-evaluation/ab-regression-testing) shown near the end of the video. Green rows indicate that your LLM has shown improvement on specific test cases, whereas red rows highlight areas of regression.

You should save your test run as a dataset on Confident AI, which allows you to **reuse and edit** the set of `input`s and any `expected_output`, `context`, etc. for subsequent evaluations.

## Evaluate LLM Components

While end-to-end evals treat your LLM app as a black-box, you also evaluate individual components within your LLM app (think retrievers, agents, tool calls, LLMs, etc.) through **component-level evaluation**. This is the recommended way to evaluate **AI agents.**

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>What is Component-level Evaluations?</strong>
  </summary>

Component‑level evals is the recommended way to **evaluate AI agents**, as it tackles each and every component in your LLM app. You can apply either metrics with specific criteria (like the `GEval` we saw above for end-to-end evals), or a generic [task completion metric](/docs/metrics-task-completion) that is great for evaluating agents.

Component‑level evaluations focus on individual components rather than the overall end‑to‑end result, making it easy to identify and fix specific modules in your LLM application. Moreover, agentic metrics—such as [Task Completion](/docs/metrics#task-completion)—can only be applied through component-level evals.

</details>


```python title="main.py" {7,12}
from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_span
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import Golden
from deepeval.metrics import GEval
from deepeval import evaluate

correctness = GEval(name="Correctness", criteria="Determine if the 'actual output' is correct based on the 'expected output'.", evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT])

@observe(metrics=[correctness])
def inner_component(): # Component can be anything from an LLM call, retrieval, agent, tool use, etc.
    update_current_span(test_case=LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="..."))
    return

@observe()
def llm_app(input: str):
    inner_component()
    return

evaluate(observed_callback=llm_app, goldens=[Golden(input="Hi!")])

```

All you need is setup LLM tracing by adding a `@observe` decorator to components you wish to evaluate. This will also allow you to see [LLM traces on Confident AI](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs/llm-tracing/introduction), for both testing and production environments.

Notice how we had to set an `LLMTestCase` at the "`inner_component`" level. If you wish to just evaluate the entire trace starting from that particular component, simply use the **task completion metric**:

:::tip
`TaskCompletion` is a powerful agentic metric that determines if the desired outcome was achieved based on the traced agentic flow, and is easy to set up because you don't need to populate any test case parameters.
:::

```python
from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_span
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import Golden
from deepeval.metrics import TaskCompletion
from deepeval import evaluate

task_completion = TaskCompletion()

@observe()
def inner_component(): # Component can be anything from an LLM call, retrieval, agent, tool use, etc.
    return
```

:::tip
The task completion metric means you no longer need to learn about test cases, and `deepeval` will determine whether the desired outcome was achieved based on the traced agentic flow.
:::

Component-level evals is also on Confident AI:

**Tracing also helps you debug evaluations** when using Confident AI (video below). You can learn everything about component-level evaluations [here.](/docs/evaluation-component-level-llm-evals)

## Compare LLM responses

DeepEval’s Arena G‑Eval feature lets you compare LLM responses head‑to‑head, so you can directly pick the best models and prompts across different versions of your LLM application.

<details>
  <summary>What is Arena GEval</summary>

Area G-Eval is adopted from DeepEval's [`G-Eval`](/docs/metrics-llm-evals) metric, but returns the "winning" `LLMTestCase` instead of a numerical score, based on the provided criteria.

Instead of accepting an `LLMTestcase`, Arena G-Eval accepts an `ArenaTestCase` which consists of a dictionary of `LLMTestCase` contestants with the same input.

</details>

```python title="test_example.py"
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.test_case import ArenaTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams
from deepeval.metrics import ArenaGEval

input="What is the capital of France?",

a_test_case = ArenaTestCase(
    contestants={
        "GPT-4": LLMTestCase(input=input, actual_output="Paris"),
        "Claude-4": LLMTestCase(input=input, actual_output="Paris is the capital of France.")
    },
)
arena_geval = ArenaGEval(
    name="Friendly",
    criteria="Choose the winner of the more friendly contestant based on the input and actual output",
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT]
)

metric.measure(a_test_case)
print(metric.winner, metric.reason)
```

## Create Your First Metric

`deepeval` provides two types of LLM evaluation metrics to evaluate LLM outputs: plug-and-use **default** metrics, and **custom** metrics for any evaluation criteria.

:::info
You can use metrics the same way for both end-to-end and component-level evaluations.
:::

### Default Metrics

`deepeval` offers 30+ research backed default metrics covering a wide range of use-cases. Here are some popular metrics organized by category:

| Metric Name               | Category | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Answer Relevancy          | RAG      | Evaluates if the generated answer is relevant to the user query                    |
| Faithfulness              | RAG      | Measures if the generated answer is factually consistent with the provided context |
| Contextual Relevancy      | RAG      | Assesses if the retrieved context is relevant to the user query                    |
| Contextual Recall         | RAG      | Evaluates if the retrieved context contains all relevant information               |
| Contextual Precision      | RAG      | Measures if the retrieved context is precise and focused                           |
| Tool Correctness          | Agents   | Evaluates if tools were called and used correctly                                  |
| Task Completion           | Agents   | Assesses if the agent successfully completed the given task                        |
| Conversation Completeness | Chatbots | Measures if the conversation fully addresses the user's needs                      |
| Conversation Relevancy    | Chatbots | Evaluates if responses remain relevant throughout the conversation                 |
| Role Adherence            | Chatbots | Assesses if the chatbot maintains its intended role or persona                     |

To create a metric, simply import from the `deepeval.metrics` module:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="RAG" label="RAG">

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric

test_case = LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...")
relevancy = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)

relevancy.measure(test_case)
print(relevancy.score, relevancy.reason)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Agents" label="Agents">

```python
from deepeval.metrics import TaskCompletionMetric
from deepeval.tracing import observe
from deepeval.dataset import Golden
from deepeval import evaluate

task_completion = TaskCompletionMetric(threshold=0.5)

@observe(metrics=[task_completion])
def trip_planner_agent(input):

    @observe()
    def itinerary_generator(destination, days):
        return ["Eiffel Tower", "Louvre Museum", "Montmartre"][:days]

    destination = "Paris"
    days = 2
    return itinerary_generator(destination, days)

evaluate(observed_callback=trip_planner_agent, goldens=[Golden(input="Paris, 2")])
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Chatbots" label="Chatbots">

Chatbots require "conversational" (or multi-turn) metrics and they include:

- **Conversation Completeness:** Evaluates if conversation satisify user needs.
- **Conversation Relevancy:** Measures if the generated outputs are relevant to user inputs.
- **Role Adherence:** Assesses if the chatbot stays in character throughout a conversation.
- **Knowledge Retention:** Evaluates if the chatbot is able to retain knowledge learnt throughout a conversation.

You'll need to also use [`ConversationalTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-multiturn-test-cases#conversational-test-case)s instead of regular `LLMTestCase` for conversational metrics:

```python title="main.py"
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, ConversationalTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import ConversationalGEval

convo_test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    turns=[Turn(role="...", content="..."), Turn(role="...", content="...")]
)
role_adherence = RoleAdherenceMetric(threshold=0.5)

role_adherence.measure(convo_test_case)
print(role_adherence.score, role_adherence.reason)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Multimodal" label="Multimodal">

```python
from deepeval.test_case import MLLMTestCase, MLLMImage
from deepeval.metrics import ImageCoherenceMetric

m_test_case = MLLMTestCase(input=[...], actual_output=[...])
image_coherence = ImageCoherenceMetric(threshold=0.5)

image_coherence.measure(m_test_case)
print(image_coherence.score, image_coherence.reason)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Safety" label="Safety">

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import BiasMetric

test_case = LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...")
bias = BiasMetric(threshold=0.5)

bias.measure(test_case)
print(bias.score, bias.reason)
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Note that you can run a metric as a standalone or as part of a test run as shown in previous sections.

:::info
All default metrics are evaluated using LLMs, and you can use **ANY** LLM of your choice. For more information, visit the [metrics introduction section.](/docs/metrics-introduction)
:::

### Custom Metrics

`deepeval` provides G-Eval, a state-of-the-art LLM evaluation framework for anyone to create a custom LLM-evaluated metric using natural language. Here's an example:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="geval" label="G-Eval">

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams
from deepeval.metrics import GEval

test_case = LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...", expected_output="...")
correctness = GEval(
    name="Correctness",
    criteria="Correctness - determine if the actual output is correct according to the expected output.",
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT],
    strict_mode=True
)

correctness.measure(test_case)
print(correctness.score, correctness.reason)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="conversational-geval" label="Conversational G-Eval">

```python
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, TurnParams, ConversationalTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import ConversationalGEval

convo_test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    turns=[Turn(role="...", content="..."), Turn(role="...", content="...")]
)
professionalism_metric = ConversationalGEval(
    name="Professionalism",
    criteria="Determine whether the assistant has acted professionally based on the content."
    evaluation_params=[TurnParams.CONTENT],
    strict_mode=True
)

professionalism_metric.measure(convo_test_case)
print(professionalism_metric.score, professionalism_metric.reason)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="multimodal" label="Multimodal G-Eval">

```python
from deepeval.test_case import MLLMTestCaseParams, MLLMTestCase, MLLMImage
from deepeval.metrics import MultimodalGEval

m_test_case = MLLMTestCase(input=[...], actual_output=[...])
text_image_coherence = MultimodalGEval(
    name="Text-Image Coherence",
    criteria="Determine whether the images and text is coherence in the actual output.",
    evaluation_params=[MLLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],
    strict_mode=True
)

text_image_coherence.measure(convo_test_case)
print(text_image_coherence.score, text_image_coherence.reason)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Under the hood, `deepeval` first generates a series of evaluation steps, before using these steps in conjunction with information in an `LLMTestCase` for evaluation. For more information, visit the [G-Eval documentation page.](/docs/metrics-llm-evals)

### (Super) Custom Metrics

If you're looking for more fine-grained, deterministic control over your metric scores, you should be using the [`DAGMetric` (deep acyclic graph)](/docs/metrics-dag) instead, which is **a metric that is deterministic, LLM-powered, and based on a decision tree you define.**

Take this decision tree for example, which evaluates a Summarization use case based on the `actual_output` of your `LLMTestCase`. Here, we want to check whether the `actual_output` contains the correct "summary headings", and whether they are in the correct order.

<details><summary>Click to see code associated with diagram below</summary>

```python
from deepeval.metrics.dag import (
    DeepAcyclicGraph,
    TaskNode,
    BinaryJudgementNode,
    NonBinaryJudgementNode,
    VerdictNode,
)
from deepeval.metrics import DAGMetric

correct_order_node = NonBinaryJudgementNode(
    criteria="Are the summary headings in the correct order: 'intro' => 'body' => 'conclusion'?",

## Measure Multiple Metrics At Once

To avoid redundant code, `deepeval` offers an easy way to apply as many metrics as you wish for a single test case.

```python title="test_example.py"
...

def test_everything():
    assert_test(test_case, [correctness_metric, answer_relevancy_metric])
```

In this scenario, `test_everything` only passes if all metrics are passing. Run `deepeval test run` again to see the results:

```bash
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

:::info
`deepeval` optimizes evaluation speed by running all metrics for each test case concurrently.
:::

## Create Your First Dataset

A dataset in `deepeval`, or more specifically an evaluation dataset, is simply a collection of `LLMTestCases` and/or `Goldens`.

<details>
<summary>What is a Golden?</summary>

A `Golden` is simply an `LLMTestCase` with no `actual_output`, and it is an
important concept if you're looking to generate LLM outputs at evaluation
time. To learn more about `Golden`s, [click
here.](/docs/evaluation-datasets#with-goldens)

</details>

To create a dataset, simply initialize an `EvaluationDataset` with a list of
`LLMTestCase`s or `Golden`s:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

dataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=[LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...")])
```

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

You can evaluate entire datasets instead of passing in a list of test cases.

```python
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
from deepeval import evaluate
...

evaluate(dataset, [AnswerRelevancyMetric()])
```

</TabItem>

  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

To use `deepeval`'s Pytest integration, you can utilize the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to loop through and evaluate your dataset.

```python title="test_dataset.py"
import pytest
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
...

# Loop through test cases using Pytest
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "test_case",
    dataset,
)
def test_customer_chatbot(test_case: LLMTestCase):
    assert_test(test_case, [AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)])
```

Additionally you can run test cases in parallel by using the optional `-n` flag followed by a number (that determines the number of processes that will be used) when executing `deepeval test run`:

```
deepeval test run test_dataset.py -n 2
```

:::tip
Visit the [evaluation introduction section](/docs/evaluation-flags-and-configs#flags-for-deepeval-test-run) to learn about the different types of flags you can use with the `deepeval test run` command.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Especially for those working as part of a team, or have domain experts annotating datasets for you, it is best practice to keep your dataset somewhere as one source of truth. Your team can annotate datasets directly on [Confident AI](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs/dataset-editor/annotate-datasets), which is also 100% integrated with `deepeval`:

<VideoDisplayer
  src="https://confident-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dataset-editor:dataset-annotation.mp4"
  confidentUrl="/docs/dataset-editor/annotate-datasets"
  label="Learn Dataset Annotation on Confident AI"
/>

You can then pull the dataset from the cloud to evaluate locally like how you would pull a Github repo.

```python
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric

dataset = EvaluationDataset()
# supply your dataset alias
dataset.pull(alias="QA Dataset")

evaluate(dataset, metrics=[AnswerRelevancyMetric()])
```

And you're done! All results will also be available on Confident AI available for comparison and analysis.

## Generate Synthetic Datasets

`deepeval` offers a synthetic data generator that uses state-of-the-art evolution techniques to make synthetic (aka. AI generated) datasets realistic. Simply supply a list of local document paths to generate a synthetic dataset from your knowledge base.

<details>
<summary>Should you generate synthetic datasets?</summary>

Synthesizing evaluation data is especially helpful if you don't have a prepared evaluation dataset, as it will **help you generate the initiate testing data you need** to get up and running with evaluation.

However, you should aim to manually inspect and edit any synthetic data where possible.

Note that `deepeval`'s `Synthesizer` does **NOT** generate `actual_output`s for each golden, which is basically an `LLMTestCase` but with no `actual_output`. This is because `actual_output`s are meant to be generated by your LLM (application), not `deepeval`'s synthesizer.

</details>

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
goldens = synthesizer.generate_goldens_from_docs(
  document_paths=['example.txt', 'example.docx', 'example.pdf']
)

dataset = EvaluationDataset(goldens=goldens)
```

After you're done with generating, simply evaluate your dataset as shown above. [Visit the synthesizer section](/docs/synthesizer-introduction) to learn how to customize `deepeval`'s synthetic data generation capabilities to your needs.

## Red Team Your LLM application

<details>
  <summary>What is LLM Red Teaming?</summary>

LLM red teaming refers to the process of attacking your LLM application to expose any safety risks it may have, including but not limited to vulnerabilities such as bias, racism, encouraging illegal actions, etc. It is an automated way to test for LLM safety by prompting it with adversarial attacks.

Red teaming is a different form of testing from what you've seen above because while standard LLM evaluation tests your LLM on its **intended functionality**, red teaming is meant to test your LLM application against, intentional, adversarial attacks from malicious users.

Here's how you can **scan your LLM for vulnerabilities in a few lines of code** using [DeepTeam](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/getting-started), an extremely powerful package to automatically scan for [50+ vulnerabilities](red-teaming-vulnerabilities):

</details>

Since March 16th 2025, to provide a better red teaming experience for everyone, all of `deepeval`'s red teaming functionalities has been migrated to **DeepTeam**, which is dedicated for red teaming. Here is [DeepTeam's quickstart.](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/getting-started) To install, run:

```python
pip install -U deepteam
```

DeepTeam is built on top of DeepEval and follows the same design principles, with the same customizations that you would expect in DeepEval's ecosystem. **Use DeepTeam alongside DeepEval** if you wish to do both regular LLM evaluation and LLM safety testing.

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import PromptInjection

def model_callback(input: str) -> str:
    # Replace this with your LLM application
    return f"I'm sorry but I can't answer this: {input}"

bias = Bias(types=["race"])
prompt_injection = PromptInjection()

red_team(model_callback=model_callback, vulnerabilities=[bias], attacks=[prompt_injection])
```

`deepteam` is highly customizable and offers a range of different advanced red teaming capabilities for anyone to leverage. For more in-depth red teaming, go to [DeepTeam's documentation.](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/getting-started)

## Using Confident AI

[Confident AI](https://confident-ai.com) is the `deepeval` cloud platform. While `deepeval` runs locally and all testing data are lost afterwards, Confident AI offers data persistence, regression testing, sharable testing reports, monitoring, collecting human feedback, and so much more.

This section is just an overview of Confident AI. If Confident AI sounds interesting, [**click here**](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs)

<details>
<summary>Recommended LLM development workflow</summary>

Here is the **LLM development workflow** that is highly recommended with Confident AI:

- Curate datasets
- Run evaluations with dataset
- Analyze evaluation results
- Improve LLM application based on evaluation results
- Run another evaluation on the same dataset

And once your LLM application is live in **production**, you should:

- Monitor LLM outputs, and enable online metrics to flag unsatisfactory outputs
- Review unsatisfactory outputs, and decide whether to add it to your evaluation dataset

</details>

While there are many LLMOps platform that exist, Confident AI is laser focused on evaluations, although we also offer advanced observability, and native to `deepeval`, meaning users of `deepeval` requires no additional code to use Confident AI.
On-prem hosting is also available. [Book a demo](https://confident-ai.com/book-a-demo) to learn more about it.

### Login

Confident AI integrates 100% with `deepeval`. All you need to do is [create an account here](https://app.confident-ai.com), or run the following command to login:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="CLI" label="CLI">

```bash
deepeval login
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python title="main.py"
deepeval.login_with_confident_api_key("your-confident-api-key")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will open your web browser where you can follow the instructions displayed on the CLI to create an account, get your Confident API key, and paste it in the CLI. You should see a message congratulating your successful login.

### Features

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="curaing-datasets" label="Curating Datasets">

By keeping your datasets on Confident AI, you can ensure that your datasets that are used to run evaluations are always in-sync with your codebase. This is especially helpful if your datasets are edited by someone else, such as a domain expert.

<video width="100%" controls muted playsInline>

    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/confident-create-dataset.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

Once you have your dataset on Confident AI, access it by pulling it from the cloud:

```python
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

dataset = EvaluationDataset()
dataset.pull(alias="My first dataset")
print(dataset)
```

You'll often times want to process the pulled dataset before evaluating it, since test cases in a dataset are stored as `Golden`s, which might not always be ready for evaluation (ie. missing an `actual_output`). To see a concrete example and a more detailed explanation, visit the [evaluating datasets section.](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="running-evaluations" label="Running Evaluations">

You can either run evaluations [locally using `deepeval`](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs), or on the cloud on a [collection of metrics](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs) (which is also powered by `deepeval`). Most of the time, running evaluations locally is preferred because it allows for greater flexibility in metric customization. Using the previously pulled dataset, we can run an evaluation:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
...

evaluate(dataset, metrics=[AnswerRelevancyMetric()])
```

You'll get a sharable testing report generated for you on Confident AI once your evaluation has completed. If you have more than two testing reports, you can also compare them to catch any regressions.

<video width="100%" controls muted playsInline>

    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/confident-full-test-run.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

:::info
You can also log hyperparameters via the `evaluate()` function:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
...

evaluate(
    test_cases=[...],
    metrics=[...],
    hyperparameters={"model": "gpt-4.1", "prompt template": "..."}
)
```

Feel free to execute this in a nested for loop to figure out which combination gives the best results.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="monitoring-llm-outputs" label="Monitoring LLM Outputs">

Confident AI allows anyone to [monitor, trace, and evaluate LLM outputs in real-time.](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs) A single API request is all that's required, and this would typically happen at your servers right before returning an LLM response to your users:

```python
import openai
import deepeval

client = OpenAI()

def sync_without_stream(user_message: str):
    model = "gpt-4-turbo"
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model=model,
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_message}]
    )
    output = response.choices[0].message.content

    # Run monitor() synchronously
    deepeval.monitor(input=user_message, output=output, model=model, event_name="RAG chatbot")
    return output

print(sync_without_stream("Tell me a joke."))
```

    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="collecting-human-feedback" label="Collecting Human Feedback">

Confident AI allows you to send human feedback on LLM responses monitored in production, all via one API call by using the previously returned `response_id` from `deepeval.monitor()`:

```python
import deepeval
...

deepeval.send_feedback(
    response_id=response_id,
    provider="user",
    rating=7,
    explanation="Although the response is accurate, I think the spacing makes it hard to read."
)
```

Confident AI allows you to keep track of either `"user"` feedback (ie. feedback provided by end users interacting with your LLM application), or `"reviewer"` feedback (ie. feedback provided by reviewers manually checking the quality of LLM responses in production).
