This tutorial walks you through the entire process of developing a reliable **LLM-powered medical chatbot**, from initial stages to post production observability with the help of **DeepEval**.

:::note
If you are working with **multi-turn chatbots**, this tutorial will be helpful to you. We will go through the entire process of building a reliable _multi-turn chatbot_ and how to evaluate it using `deepeval`

## Medical Chatbot

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have built a reliable **medical chatbot** that answers user's queries, diagnoses their symptoms as well as book appointments for them. It will be a _conversational chatbot_
which can converse in multiple turns with a user and remember their symptoms to book appointments with its findings from the entire conversation.

We will ensure that this chatbot is reliable by testing it using `deepeval`'s [`ConversationSimulator`](https://deepeval.com/docs/conversation-simulator) which will interact with your chatbot like a real user and create multi-turn [`ConversationalTestCase`](https://deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-multiturn-test-cases), which you can use to test your chatbot.

## What You'll Build

Multi-turn chatbots have become very common now, they are used in various fields like medical, finance, and more. Their ability to remember the previous conversation and handle follow-up questions make them viable assistants in various sectors that require back-and-forth exchanges for services. And in this tutorial, we are going to build a medical chatbot, that can converse with you and remember your symptoms to diagnose you and schedule an appointment with your information. 
Here's what the medical assistant will look like:

The above image shows the overview of what a medical chatbot would look like in a user-friendly interface. It just takes the user input and generates the appropriate response. 

In the rest of this tutorial series, you'll build a medical chatbot that can handle multi-turn conversations and you'll learn how to evaluate a conversational chatbot using `deepeval`
