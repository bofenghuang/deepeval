In this section, we are going to create a **conversational medical chatbot** that can use various tools to diagnose and schedule appointments for users based on their symptoms.
We will be using `langchain` and `qdrant` to build our chatbot.

:::info
For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll be using a text version of [The Gale Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine](https://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files/03cb46934164321f675385fb74ac1bed.pdf) as our knowledge base. You will need to convert this to a `.txt` file for the code to work.
:::

## Developing The Chatbot

We will use `langchain`'s OpenAI [chat model](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/) to create our main chatbot. You can use your own model here, but ensure your model supports `langchain`'s agentic api usage. Here's how you can create an OpenAI chat model using `langchain`:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

class MedicalChatbot:
    def __init__(self, model="gpt-4o-mini"):
        self.model = ChatOpenAI(model=model)
        # Choose the LLM that will drive the agent
        # Only certain models support this so ensure your model supports it as well
```

You can use your chatbot as shown below:

```python
messages = [
    ("system", "You are a medical assistant, help user's with their concerns in a gentle way"),
    ("user", "I have fever and cold.")
]
chatbot = MedicalChatbot()
chatbot.model.invoke(messages)
```
This above code gives an output similar to the following:

```text
AIMessage(content="Okay, I understand you're experiencing a fever and a cold. I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well.\n\nTo help me understand your situation better and offer some helpful advice, could you tell me a little more about your symptoms? For example:\n\n*   **How high is your fever?** Have you taken your temperature?\n*   **What other symptoms do you have besides fever and cold?** (e.g., cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, congestion, runny nose, sneezing, fatigue)\n*   **How long have you been feeling this way?**\n*   **Do you have any underlying health conditions?**\n*   **Are you taking any medications?**\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general recommendations for managing a fever and cold:\n\n*   **Rest:** Get plenty of sleep and avoid strenuous activities.\n*   **Hydration:** Drink lots of fluids like water, clear broths, and herbal tea.\n*   **Over-the-counter medications:** Consider using over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) to reduce fever and body aches. Decongestants or antihistamines might help with congestion and a runny nose. *Always follow the instructions on the label and talk to a pharmacist if you have any questions.*\n*   **Sore throat relief:** Gargle with warm salt water or use throat lozenges.\n*   **Humidifier:** Use a humidifier or take a steamy shower to help loosen congestion.\n\n**Important Note:** While these are general recommendations, it's always best to seek advice from a healthcare professional for personalized guidance. If your symptoms worsen, you have difficulty breathing, experience chest pain, or have any other concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention promptly.\n\nI'm here to listen and provide information to the best of my ability. Please feel free to share more details, and I'll do my best to assist you.", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--c2786aa1-75c4-4644-ae59-9327a2e8c153-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 23, 'output_tokens': 417, 'total_tokens': 440, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})
```

## Creating Tools

We will now create various tools for our chatbot to use, this will allow our chatbot to use an external knowledge base to do diagnosis on symptoms specified and also create or update meeting appointments for the user.

### Creating RAG Engine

We will use the [Gale Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine](https://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files/03cb46934164321f675385fb74ac1bed.pdf) as our knowledge base and store it in a vector database. This will allow us to create a **RAG engine** which can handle all patient diagnosis.
We will use `qdrant` and `sentence-transformers` to create and store our vector database. Here's how we can do that:

```python
from qdrant_client import models, QdrantClient
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

class MedicalChatbot:
    def __init__(self, document_path, model="gpt-4o-mini"):
        self.model = ChatOpenAI(model=model)
        self.appointments = {}
        self.encoder = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
        self.client = QdrantClient(":memory:")
        self.store_data(document_path)

    def store_data(self, document_path):
        with open(document_path) as file:
            documents = file.readlines()

        self.client.create_collection(
            collection_name="gale_encyclopedia",
            vectors_config=models.VectorParams(
                size=self.encoder.get_sentence_embedding_dimension(),  # Vector size is defined by used model
                distance=models.Distance.COSINE,
            ),
        )

        self.client.upload_points(
            collection_name="gale_encyclopedia",
            points=[
                models.PointStruct(
                    id=idx, vector=self.encoder.encode(doc).tolist(), payload={"content": doc}
                ) for idx, doc in enumerate(documents)
            ],
        )
```

We can now create a query engine and use it to retrieve information for the medical chatbot. Here's how we can do that:

```python
from qdrant_client import models, QdrantClient
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool

class MedicalChatbot:
    def __init__(self, document_path, model="gpt-4o-mini"):
        ...

    def store_data(self, document_path):
        ...

    @tool
    def query_engine(self, query: str) -> str:
        """"A tool to retrive data on various diagnosis methods from gale encyclopedia"""
        # Give an appropriate description of the tool
        hits = self.client.query_points(
            collection_name="my_books",
            query=encoder.encode("alien invasion").tolist(),
            limit=3,
        ).points

        contexts = [hit.payload['content'] for hit in hits]
        return "\n".join(contexts)
```

### Function-calling Tools

We can now create different functions to create, update and delete appointments for the user. Before we begin, since our chatbot will be recording patient information, we'll need a structured way to store it. We'll define a pydantic model with the relevant fields (symptoms, diagnoses, and personal information) to ensure that our agent can accurately store data in the correct format. Here's how we can do that:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class MedicalAppointment(BaseModel):
    name: Optional[str] = None
    email: Optional[str] = None
    date: Optional[str] = None
    symptoms: Optional[str] = None
    diagnosis: Optional[str] = None
```

Functions to store data in the model

```python
...
class MedicalChatbot:
    def __init__(self, document_path, model="gpt-4o-mini"):
        ...

    def store_data(self, document_path):
        ...

    @tool
    def query_engine(self, query: str) -> str:
        ...

    # Retrieves the current state of an appointment based on its ID.
    @tool
    def get_appointment_state(self, appointment_id: str) -> str:
        try:
            return str(self.appointments[appointment_id].dict())
        except KeyError:
            return f"Appointment ID {appointment_id} not found"

    # Updates a specific property of an appointment.
    @tool
    def update_appointment(self, appointment_id: str, property: str, value: str) -> str:
        appointment = self.appointments.get(appointment_id)
        if appointment:
            setattr(appointment, property, value)
            return f"Appointment ID {appointment_id} updated with {property} = {value}"
        return "Appointment not found"

    # Creates a new appointment with a unique ID.
    @tool
    def create_appointment(self, appointment_id: str) -> str:
        self.appointments[appointment_id] = MedicalAppointment()
        return "Appointment created."

    # Records a diagnosis for an appointment after symptoms have been noted.
    @tool
    def record_diagnosis(self, appointment_id: str, diagnosis: str) -> str:
        appointment: MedicalAppointment = self.appointments.get(appointment_id)
        if appointment and appointment.symptoms:
            appointment.diagnosis = diagnosis
            return f"Diagnosis recorded for Appointment ID {appointment_id}. Diagnosis: {diagnosis}"
        return "Diagnosis cannot be recorded. Please tell me more about your symptoms."
```

Now we can create a function to setup all our tools at once, here's the code for that:

```python
from langchain_core.tools import StructuredTool

class MedicalChatbot:
    ...

    def setup_tools(self):
        self.get_appointment_state_tool = StructuredTool.from_function(func=self.get_appointment_state)
        self.update_appointment_tool = StructuredTool.from_function(func=self.update_appointment)
        self.create_appointment_tool = StructuredTool.from_function(func=self.create_appointment)
        self.record_diagnosis_tool = StructuredTool.from_function(func=self.record_diagnosis)
        self.medical_diagnosis_tool = StructuredTool.from_function(func=self.query_engine)
        # You can add your names and descriptions for these tools as needed
```

Here are the tools we've created:

- `get_appointment_state_tool`: Retrieves the state of a specific appointment.
- `update_appointment_tool`: Updates a property of an appointment.
- `create_appointment_tool`: Creates a new appointment.
- `record_diagnosis_tool`: Records a diagnosis for an appointment.

## Creating Interactive Session

Now that we have set up the tools and data systems, it's time to finalize the chatbot agent. Using the `langchain`'s `create_tool_calling_agent` and `AgentExecutor` to dynamically manage user interactions and choose the appropriate tool based on the input and context. This involves defining the LLM, system prompt, and tool integrations.

```python
from langchain.agents import create_tool_calling_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor

...
class MedicalChatbot:
    ...
    def setup_agent(self, system_prompt: str):
        tools = [
            self.get_appointment_state_tool,
            self.update_appointment_tool,
            self.create_appointment_tool,
            self.record_diagnosis_tool,
            self.medical_diagnosis_tool,
        ]
        system_prompt = system_prompt or (
            "..." # Your system prompt here
        )

        agent = create_tool_calling_agent(self.model, tools, system_prompt)
        self.agent_executer = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)
```

Finally, we'll create an interactive environment where users can engage with the chatbot. This involves configuring input/output, managing conversation flow, and processing user queries.

```python
...
class MedicalChatbot:
    ...
    def interactive_session(self):
        print("Hello! I am Baymax, your personal health care companian")
        print("Please enter your symptoms or ask about appointment details. Type 'exit' to quit.")

        while True:
            user_input = input("Your query: ")
            if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
                break

            response = self.agent_executer.invoke({"input": user_input})
            print("Agent Response:", response["output"])
```

We now have an interactive chatbot but it doesn't have memory, we will now add memory to our chatbot.

## Adding memory

We will use `langchain` to add memory to our chatbot using `RunnableWithMessageHistory`. Here's how we can do that:

```python
from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import ChatMessageHistory
from langchain_core.chat_history import BaseChatMessageHistory
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory

store = {}

def get_session_history(session_id: str) -> BaseChatMessageHistory:
    if session_id not in store:
        store[session_id] = ChatMessageHistory()
    return store[session_id]
```

We can now change the setup agent to use a new agent with chat history and update our interactive session

```python
from langchain.agents import create_tool_calling_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder

...
class MedicalChatbot:
    ...
    def setup_agent(self, system_prompt: str):
        tools = [
            self.get_appointment_state_tool,
            self.update_appointment_tool,
            self.create_appointment_tool,
            self.record_diagnosis_tool,
            self.medical_diagnosis_tool,
        ]
        prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
            [
                ("system", system_prompt),
                MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="chat_history"),
                ("human", "{input}"),
                MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="agent_scratchpad"),
            ]
        )

        agent = create_tool_calling_agent(self.model, tools, prompt)
        self.agent_executer = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)
        self.agent_with_chat_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
            self.agent_executer,
            get_session_history,
            input_messages_key="input",
            history_messages_key="chat_history",
        )

    def interactive_session(self, session_id):
        print("Hello! I am Baymax, your personal health care companian")
        print("Please enter your symptoms or ask about appointment details. Type 'exit' to quit.")

        while True:
            user_input = input("Your query: ")
            if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
                break

            response = self.agent_with_chat_history.invoke(
                {"input": user_input},
                config={"configurable": {"session_id": session_id}}
            )
            print("Agent Response:", response["output"])
```

We have now created a complete medical chatbot with chat history using `langchain`. Here's how we can use our chatbot:

```python
chatbot = MedicalChatbot("gale_encyclopedia.txt")
chatbot.interactive_session(1)
```

Here's an example output of how the chatbot works now:

```text
Hello! I am Baymax, your personal health care companion
Please enter your symptoms or ask about appointment details. Type 'exit' to quit.

Your query: Hello Baymax, I've been feeling unwell. I have a fever and a sore throat.
Agent Response: I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling well. A fever is an elevated body temperature, often a sign of infection, and a sore throat is a common symptom of upper respiratory infections like the common cold. For a fever, rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers can help. For a sore throat, rest, fluids, and sometimes decongestants are recommended. If your symptoms are severe or persistent, it's always best to consult a doctor. Would you like to schedule an appointment to discuss your symptoms further?

```

Now that we're done with the development of medical chatbot, in the next section we're going to see [how to evauate your chatbot](/tutorials/medical-chatbot/tutorial-medical-chatbot-evaluation) using `deepeval`.
