In this section, we're going to create our **RAG QA Agent** using **_Langchain_** and **_OpenAI_**. A RAG application typically consists of two
components — A **retriever** and a **generator**.

The retriever is used for retrieving all the relevant documents from the knowledge base for a given query. 
The generator is responsible for generating an answer to the user's query by using the retrieved context. 
Both of them combined make up a RAG (_Retrieval-Augmented Generation_) application.

## Creating The RAG Agent

We are going to create a class called `RAGAgent` that combines both the retriever and generator's responses to answer the user's query. 
We'll separate retrieval and generation into two different helper functions. This allows us to evaluate our retriever 
and generator's quality independently, which helps us improve our agent in later stages. Before we can retrieve any data, we first need to store our 
data in a database that the retriever can easily access and look through. We can do this using vector stores offered by `langchain`.

:::note
A **vector store** is a specialized database that efficiently stores and indexes **vector embeddings** (numerical representations of data's 
meaning) to enable rapid **similarity search**, it is crucial for AI applications like RAG.
:::

We can use various embedding models that can convert data into numerical representations of their meanings to turn our data into a vector 
store — our knowledge base. We will be using the `OpenAIEmbeddings` and `FAISS` vector store provided by `langchain` for this example, you 
can use any embedding model and vector store you like. Here's how to create a vector store for our data using `langchain`:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

class RAGAgent:
    def __init__(
        self,
        document_paths: list,
        embedding_model=None,
        chunk_size: int = 500,
        chunk_overlap: int = 50,
        vector_store_class=FAISS,
        k: int = 2
    ):
        self.document_paths = document_paths
        self.chunk_size = chunk_size
        self.chunk_overlap = chunk_overlap
        self.embedding_model = embedding_model or OpenAIEmbeddings()
        self.vector_store_class = vector_store_class
        self.k = k
        self.vector_store = self._load_vector_store()
    
    def _load_vector_store(self):
        documents = []
        for document_path in self.document_paths:
            with open(document_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
                raw_text = file.read()
            
            splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
                chunk_size=self.chunk_size,
                chunk_overlap=self.chunk_overlap
            )
            documents.extend(splitter.create_documents([raw_text]))

        return self.vector_store_class.from_documents(documents, self.embedding_model)
```

You can modify the above code to use an embedding model or vector store of your choice. Next, we'll define a `retrieve()` method to fetch relevant documents from the vector store.

### Creating Retriever

In the context of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, the retriever is a crucial component responsible for efficiently identifying and 
extracting the most relevant information from a large, external knowledge base — our vector store in this case. We will now create a `retrieve()` function in our `RAGAgent` class 
that allows us to retrieve the relevant data for a particular query. Here's how we can do that:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

class RAGAgent:
    def __init(...):
        ...
    
    def _load_vector_store(...):
        ...

    def retrieve(self, query: str):
        return self.vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=self.k)
```

This allows us to retrieve `k` documents that are most relevant to the `query` we supplied by using similarity search. We can test our retriever with the following code:

```python
doc_path = ["theranos_legacy.txt"]

retriever = RAGAgent(doc_path)
retrieved_docs = retriever.retrieve("How many blood tests can you perform and how much blood do you need?")

print(retrieved_docs)
```

Now that we have a working retriever, we can move on to creating our generator.

### Creating generator

In a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, the **generator** is the component that produces natural language responses based on 
both the input query and the retrieved documents. We will now add the `generate()` function in our `RAGAgent` class that takes the retrieved 
context and generates an answer using the `OpenAI` LLM provided by `langchain`.

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

class RAGAgent:
    def __init(...):
        ...
    
    def _load_vector_store(...):
        ...

    def retrieve(...):
        ...

    def generate(
        self,
        query: str, 
        retrieved_docs: list, 
        llm_model=None, 
        prompt_template: str = None
    ):
        context = "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs])
        model = llm_model or OpenAI(temperature=0)
        prompt = prompt_template or (
            "Answer the query using the context below.\n\nContext:\n{context}\n\nQuery:\n{query}"
            "Only use information from the context. If nothing relevant is found, respond with: 'No relevant information available.'"
        )
        prompt = prompt.format(context=context, query=query)
        return model(prompt)
```

This allows us to generate an answer to the query based on the retrieved docs. Here's how we can use our generator:

```python
doc_path = ["theranos_legacy.txt"]
query = "How many blood tests can you perform and how much blood do you need?"

retriever = RAGAgent(doc_path)
retrieved_docs = retriever.retrieve(query)
generated_answer = retriever.generate(query, retrieved_docs)

print(generated_answer)
```

This is the output of the above code:

```text
The NanoDrop 3000 can perform over 325 blood tests using just 1-2 microliters of capillary blood. 
This enables comprehensive diagnostics with minimal sample volume.
```

We can use these helper functions in a final `answer()` function that will be used to answer any query. Here's how we can do that:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

class RAGAgent:
    def __init(...):
        ...
    
    def _load_vector_store(...):
        ...

    def retrieve(...):
        ...

    def generate(...):
        ...

    def answer(
        self, 
        query: str,
        llm_model=None, 
        prompt_template: str = None
    ):
        retrieved_docs = self.retrieve(query)
        generated_answer = self.generate(query, retrieved_docs, llm_model, prompt_template)
        return generated_answer, retrieved_docs
```

We have now created a RAG Agent that answers a user's query. Now let's try and use our retriever to answer a user's query to see how it answers:

```python
document_paths = ["theranos_legacy.txt"]
query = "What is the NanoDrop 3000, and what certifications does Theranos hold?"

retriever = RAGAgent(document_paths)
answer, _ = retriever.answer(query)
```

The LLM outputs a response in markdown format by default, which makes it harder to extract structured data such as citations. This is not ideal because we cannot parse the 
output to show citations in the UI. The following is the best we can do with what our retriever generates for now:

## Updating The RAG Agent

We can update the way our agent responds by using a better prompt. This allows our agent to answer in a `json` format which helps us parse the 
given output and use it to render the data in any style we want. Here's how we'll update our `RAGAgent` class and the new prompt we'll use to generate `json` formatted answers:

We can use the following prompt template to generate our response in `json`:

```text
You are a helpful assistant. Use the context below to answer the user's query. 
Format your response strictly as a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "answer": "<a concise, complete answer to the user's query>",
  "citations": [
    "<relevant quoted snippet or summary from source 1>",
    "<relevant quoted snippet or summary from source 2>",
    ...
  ]
}

Only include information that appears in the provided context. Do not make anything up.
Only respond in JSON — No explanations needed. Only use information from the context. If 
nothing relevant is found, respond with: 

{
  "answer": "No relevant information available.",
  "citations": []
}


Context:
{context}

Query:
{query}
```

We can update our `answer()` function to parse the output as `json` and return the `json` object. Here's how to update our `answer()` function: 

```python
import json
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

class RAGAgent:
    ...

    def answer(self, query: str):
        retrieved_docs = self.retrieve(query)
        generated_answer = self.generate(query, retrieved_docs)

        try:
            res = json.loads(generated_answer)
            return res
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            return {"error": "Invalid JSON returned from model", "raw_output": generated_answer}
```

Now our `RAGAgent` outputs a valid `json`, we can use this output to render UI and create webpages or handle our responses in 
any way we want. Here's the new responses generated by our agent:

<Tabs groups="ui-raw">

<TabItem id="ui" value="UI">

  "answer": "The NanoDrop 3000 is a compact, portable diagnostic device developed by Theranos Technologies.

  "citations": [

    "Theranos labs are CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited. NanoDrop 3000 is CE-marked and pending full FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded panels."
  ]
}
```

We now have a RAG agent that generates the output in our desired format, but how reliable are the generated answers? It is very important to make sure 
that the answers generated by the agent are reliable, especially for an infamous company like **Theranos**.

In the next section, we'll see [how to evaluate our RAG QA Agent](/tutorials/rag-qa-agent/tutorial-rag-qa-evaluation) using `deepeval`.
