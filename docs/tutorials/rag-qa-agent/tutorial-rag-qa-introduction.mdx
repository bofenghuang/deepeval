This tutorial walks you through the entire process of building a reliable **RAG (_Retrieval-Augmented Generation_) QA Agent**, 
from initial development to iterative improvement through `deepeval`'s evaluations.

:::note
This tutorial focuses on building a RAG-based QA agent for an infamous company called **Theranos**. However, the concepts and practices used throughout this tutorial are applicable to any **RAG-based application**. If you are working with RAG applications, this tutorial will be helpful to you.

## What You'll Learn:

In this tutorial you'll learn:

- How to build a RAG QA agent.
- How to define evaluation criteria for your RAG agent.
- How to generate synthetic evaluation datasets to test your RAG agent.
- How to evaluate and improve your RAG agent using `deepeval`.
- How to prepare your RAG agent for deployment.

## RAG QA Agent

Throughout this tutorial, we'll build a **RAG QA agent** designed to answer questions about **Theranos**, a company specializing in blood 
diagnostics. It takes a user query as `input` and generates a response that answers the query from the the most relevant documents stored in a vector database.

Our objective is to build a reliable RAG QA agent that not only answers the user's queries but also makes sure that the answers generated
are **relevant and correct** based on the information in the documents stored. We will also ensure that the agent only answers from the retrieved 
documents and does not hallucinate — which might make the agent unreliable.

## What You'll build

RAG-based agents have become one of the most widely used AI patterns today. This is because _RAG applications provide the flexibility 
to enable AI agents to answer questions related to a specific topic by using retrieval methods to access private information from a knowledge 
base_. This allows companies to avoid fine-tuning a model on their entire database.

Companies now use RAG agents to provide customers and employees with information about their company in a much more accessible and 
flexible way. **Theranos** has also decided to use a RAG agent to answer the queries a user might have about their company and how they 
diagnose blood. 

Here's what **Theranos**'s RAG QA agent looks like:

The QA agent takes a user query as `input` and generates a relevant answer based on the retrieved context.
The answer must absolutely be related to a context from the knowledge base — which are cited for reliability. It shouldn't answer any questions if no relevant documents are found and instead, it must explain 
that there are no documents relevant to the user's query.

In the following sections of this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a reliable RAG QA Agent that retrieves correct data and generates an 
accurate answer based on the retrieved context.
